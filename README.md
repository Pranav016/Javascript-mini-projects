<h3><li>BMI Calculator:</li></h3>
BMI stands for Body Mass Index and helps an individual to measure how fit or unfit he/she is, and how much more work needs to be put in.
It is calculated mathematically using the weight(in kgs) and height(in metres) to help determine the fitness level of the individual.
<br/>

<h3><li>Dice Game:</li></h3>
The dices get rolled on refreshing the page and the player getting heigher number on the dice wins. It is a draw in case they draw the same numbers. This was implemented using the random module in Javascript.

<h3><li>DrumKit:</li></h3>
It is a digital drumset with images of all the instruments of a real drumset that play the corresponding sound on being clicked.

<h3><li>Simon Game:</li></h3>

    Simon Game rules-

    1. At the start, Simon's game will randomly give you a signal ( one color will pop up).

    2. You have to repeat the signal by pressing the same color. 

    3. Simon will duplicate the first signal and add a random one. 

    4. You need to repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in the order.

    5. Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

    6. You need to repeat these three signals in the order.

    7. Simon will repeat all three signals and add one.

    8. Continue playing as long as you can repeat the sequence.

    9. After the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, Simon will automatically speed up. That means you need to add Skill levels.

    10. If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, or if you take more then 5 seconds to repeat a signal, Simon responds with a "REZZ" sound.  That means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends. GAME OVER.

    11. If you manage to repeat of sequences for skill levels 1, 2, 3,  or 4 and Simon will salute you with six short signals from the last lens you pressed.   

    2 or more player game

    Players may team up against Simon to compete with each other.

    1. First, the players need to decide are they play against Simon or compete.

    2. Play proceeds as described in Game rules, except players take turns repeating Simon's signals.
